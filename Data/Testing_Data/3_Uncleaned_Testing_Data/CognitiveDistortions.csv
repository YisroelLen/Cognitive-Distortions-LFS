That was really a terrible day,1
I made a real fool of myself at that party. I’ll never be able to face them again,1

"if I get a bad score on this test, colleges will see that on my transcript and then I'll never get into a good school!",1
"“I’m going to get in there and forget what I’m supposed to say, stumble over my words, and completely stuff up the presentation, and this will be terrible",1
This is my fault,1
I’m to blame,1

"I feel anxious, I know something dangerous is going to happen",1
"“I feel so depressed, this must be the worst place to work in",1
"Oh, that doesn’t count, I was just lucky",1
"They don’t really mean it, they were just being polite",1
If I don't do it myself it won't get done well enough,1
He is seeing someone else,1
He wants to leave me,1
something terrible has happened to him,1
he never calls when he says he will,1
he does this to make me angry,1
he doesn't love me,1
I must be a very bad person not be happy to have these healthy kids,1
You're a fraud,1
you should do the exams,1

Why does he do this to me,1
This always happens to me,1
I’ll never learn CBT,1
It’s possible they were distracted,0
They weren’t angry last time we talked,0
I would likely know if I had done something wrong,0
It’s actually not a pattern - this doesn’t usually occur,0
"While I have struggled with presentations before, I’ve practiced and prepared for this presentation and have no proof that this will not go well",0
"I make mistakes sometimes, but in general I am not careless or irresponsible",0
I am genuinely trying my best,0
"The people my mistake impacted may have been a little upset, but there is no evidence they think I’m incompetent.",0
I can improve my work based on what I learned from my mistake,0
"I made a mistake at work, but everyone does that from time to time. I usually get a lot of positive feedback about my work. I'll be careful not to make that same mistake again.",0
It’s normal to feel and think this way. I’m just reacting like this because of that time when I was 12.,0
This is the anxiety talking,0
I don’t know what they’re really thinking,0
They’re actually probably genuinely concerned about me.,0
"They must care about me to ask, so won’t judge me negatively.",0
I would ask someone the same if I met them in these circumstances.,0
The feelings will pass,0
It’s normal to feel so tired – it’s because I’m depressed,0
"I felt a bit better yesterday after my shower, and managed to tidy up a bit",0
"If I get up now, maybe I can walk to the corner shop, then phone a friend",0
He’s probably in a hurry and just didn’t see me,0
I’m probably over-reacting a bit,0
No harm has been done really,0
I’ll have forgotten about this next week,0
I’ll feel better if I can just let this go,0
"""The flaw was minor and did not alter the conclusions",0
"The analysis was objectively sound, and my suggestion was realistic and well-founded",0
I was top of my class when I trained in the analysis method,0
"My clients respect my analysis, and my opinion",0
"My analysis was reasonable, but not perfect.",0
"There was an error, but it didn't affect the validity of the conclusions",0
"I contribute to my family in new ways, such as offering advice and support",0
"Because of my COPD and because I am getting older, I have more physical limitations than I used to, and I do need my family’s help from time to time, but I am able to offer them many valuable things and contribute to my grandkids’ lives",0
i'm actually only boring when i'm in a bad mood. when i'm in a good mood i'm pretty funny,0
I'm getting better at relationships all the time and am making a strong effort to improve my social skills and decrease my social anxiety,0
it's okay to sometime be strange. in fact people often enjoy someone who's different,0
"my family knows the real me, my ex knows the real me, and my friends know the real me. So this thought is nonsense.",0
"They might be annoyed that I wasn’t keeping up with my chores, but no one else has said or done anything that shows they hate me.",0
"I feel lonely now, but the feeling is temporary and I will adjust and make friends.",0
"I haven’t done everything that I planned, but I have done some things, like painting and cooking.",0
Recovery from depression is hard work and it takes time.,0
I am making progress,0
"I don’t know whether the therapy will work, or how I will feel in the future. All I can do is try my best today",0
"Actually, I love how I look in that black dress, I’m just so frustrated right now I’m forgetting about what’s actually good in my closet",0
"I have no way of knowing for sure that every future date will turn me down because how I’m dressed, I can’t predict the future",0
"This outfit doesn’t help me feel my best, but that’s not the case with all of my clothes",0
"I can’t predict that my co-workers will even notice how I’m dressed today, and I can’t predict what kind of people I will end up on dates with in the future",0
"Besides, I want people to appreciate me for who I am not, how I look on one particular day.",0
"It may take time, but I will find a good job.",0
"Although I lost my job, I have many past successes that will help propel my future forward",0
If the librarian is judgmental then I can cope with that. It’s highly unlikely anyone will call security and boot me out of the library or anything like that.,0
I’m expecting other people to judge me negatively for making a mistake but maybe they won’t.,0
"Other than explaining the situation politely to someone at the library, there’s nothing I can do to control their reaction and the consequences in terms of how big the fine is, so giving up trying to control this situation and using acceptance skills is wise",0
This is a situation I have the capacity to deal with. I’ve developed a pattern of avoidant coping but I can get better at non-avoidant coping through the right kind of practice. This is an opportunity for that,0
"By not mentioning this to my therapist, I’ve lost the potential opportunity to get a supportive reaction and to talk about problem solving",0
It’s understandable to want to hide and avoid in response to shame and anxiety but it’s not very helpful,0
She must have a lot on her mind.,0
My speech might only be OK but if i do mess up everyone will forget about it soon enough,0
