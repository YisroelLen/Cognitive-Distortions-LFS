Meichenbaum: Anna—is it okay if I call you Anna?
Anna: Oh, of course.
Meichenbaum Commentary: Anna is 40, the mother of two children:
Joseph, 17, and Lizzie, 13. Her husband, Patrick, is a lawyer, and Anna works
for an interior design company. She is referred by her physician because of
recurrent bouts of panic attacks with a history of depression.
Anna: Lately I’ve been having these attacks that are keeping me from
functioning. My heart starts racing. I feel like I’m suffocating, and I just
focus in on—and, uh…
Meichenbaum: Focused in—Give me a feel of what’s happening.
Anna: Well, it becomes a total preoccupation. I can’t think about anything
else but this attack. My heart starts beating, my blood starts racing. I feel
like I’m going to die. I’ve been to the emergency room three times already.
Meichenbaum: Total preoccupation?
19
Psychotherapy.net
Meichenbaum Commentary: Picking up on her descriptive phrases—
“ focusing in” and “total preoccupation”—I was able to help Anna to tell
her story. This discussion will lay the groundwork for Anna to appreciate
the interconnection between her physical symptoms and her accompanying
feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.
Anna: Patrick—that’s my husband—he was late, he lost his car keys, it was
a madhouse, and after they all got out I just started crying. I couldn’t stop.
I was uncontrollably crying.
Meichenbaum: And what happened then, when you…
Anna: Well, somehow I finally got myself together and I started to get
ready to go to work, and then I got to the car and I just froze up. My
heart started to race. I had feelings up and down my arm. I thought I was
going to pass out. I knew I had to get to the emergency room so I called
Patrick, and he was too angry. He told me if I thought I needed to go to an
emergency room, I should call someone else. So I called my son, Joe and
got him out of school to take me—I was so embarrassed—and we went to
this emergency room and saw someone, and the doctor came out and said
there was nothing wrong with my heart.
Meichenbaum: What did you think of that?
Anna: Well, I knew there was something wrong with me. I mean, these
were very physical feelings, racing up and down my arm, my heart beating
like that. He suggested I see a psychiatrist.
Meichenbaum: And did you follow that up? Did you go to see a
psychiatrist?
Anna: Yeah, I did. Well, the next day they did a battery of tests and I saw
that the results of that were all negative. And I saw a psychiatrist the next
day. He gave me some medication and it helped for a little while, but—
Meichenbaum: What was the medication for?
Anna: I don’t know. I think it was for depression.
Meichenbaum: Have you been depressed?
Anna: Well, I guess all my whole life I’ve kind of battled with bouts of
depression.
20
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
Meichenbaum: Battling depression. Give me a—
Meichenbaum Commentary: Once again, I pick up on her image: this time,
“battling depression.”
Anna: Like right now. Patrick is a lawyer and he’s busy all the time.
People look up to him. My son Joe, he’s a teenager and busy. And Lizzie is
entering that early adolescent stage where everything I do is wrong. I feel
like I’m walking on eggshells around her. I just have these feelings of being
completely worthless. I’m just, like, hopeless. I have no hope about anything.
Meichenbaum: So everything’s just bleak and there’s no—
Anna: Yeah, well, it’s like, my whole life is just a big glob of misery. It’s just
a total personal tragedy.
Meichenbaum: So it’s not just now?
Meichenbaum Commentary: Anna’s reference to her “whole life” lets
us shift the focus to the developmental background of her depression. Her
metaphors “glob of misery” and “personal tragedy” reflect her current levels
of depression and hopelessness. I’ll need to assess her suicide risk later in the
session.
Anna: Well, you might find this interesting. When my daughter was my
age—I mean, when I was my daughter’s age—my mother died of cancer,
and I felt like my whole life was over. I loved her so much, and I think what
it would be like now if—
Meichenbaum: If something happened to you?
Anna: Yeah.
Meichenbaum: What it would be—?
Anna: What it would be like for my daughter.
Meichenbaum: And you were the same age?
Meichenbaum Commentary: Could this anniversary have been a trigger for
the onset of Anna’s panic attacks?
Anna: Yeah, I was just 13.
Meichenbaum Commentary: Or did these panic episodes occur before this
coincident date?
21
Psychotherapy.net
Anna: Well, I think about what I had to do back then. I was the oldest of
three and I had to take care of my father, and my brother and my sister.
Meichenbaum: What was that like? What is it that you had to do then?
Anna: Well, my father was very depressed and drinking a lot during that
time, and he—so I had to take care of him. And I had to get up first in the
morning and I had to get breakfast for them, my brother and sister. I had
to wake up my father, which was very hard, and get him ready for work,
and then I had to get myself ready to go, too. I had to make lunches for
everybody, and during my lunch hour, I’d have to go and check on the kids
sometimes.
Meichenbaum: How did all of this make you feel?
Anna: You see, in my family, we never dealt with these feelings. We just
kind of stuffed them all down.
Meichenbaum: Stuffed them down? What is—?
Meichenbaum Commentary: Once again, I pluck and reflect the key phrase,
“Stuffed them down.”
Meichenbaum: And what was going on with your dad? You say he was
drinking and feeling depressed.
Anna: Oh, yeah.
Meichenbaum: What was involved in that?
Anna: Well, he was missing my mom, and I understood that. But I was the
oldest, and he ended up taking it out on me.
Meichenbaum: Taking it out on you?
Anna: Oh, he would make jokes like I was too stupid to… I wanted to go
to college—
Meichenbaum Commentary: Taking it out on Anna? Is this a signal that
some form of verbal or physical abuse may have taken place? I’ll need to check
this out.
Anna: I had a lot of responsibilities. I was taking care of—
Meichenbaum: And he would criticize you?
Anna: Yes, he would belittle—he would—I would say he would belittle 
22
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
me. And then I would get upset and he’d say, “Oh, I was only joking.” So—
Meichenbaum: And how would that make you feel?
Anna: Oh, it would make me feel awful, because you can’t really get mad
at a joke. I just kind of took all the—I was confused—I took all those
feelings and I just stuffed them down.
Meichenbaum: Stuffing down feelings, is that something you do now?
Anna: Um, Patrick kind of has that edge of criticism too, sometimes.
Meichenbaum: And when you have that kind of criticism, what kind of
feelings does it have for you?
Anna: Well, I suppose it makes me very angry, and that I’m told it’s just a,
“Oh, I was just joking,” or something like that, and then—
Meichenbaum: And when you get those angry feelings?
Anna: I just stuff them down. I just don’t deal with them.
Meichenbaum: And if you stuff them down in the way that you describe
with Patrick, with your dad, what is the impact that has on you, Anna?
What is the price you pay for stuffing it down like that?
Anna: I don’t know.
Meichenbaum: I don’t know, either. I think maybe that’s one of the things
we need to talk about in future sessions.
Anna: Okay.
Meichenbaum: Anna, let me see if I’ve picked up on what you’ve been
saying so far, and correct me if I’m wrong. On the one hand there’s a lot
of the panic that you’ve experienced in these attacks that you’re having,
and that’s all led you to even go to the emergency on a couple of different
occasions. It seems to me that there are just a number of different things.
Anna: Uh-hum.
Meichenbaum: One is what can we do about these attacks? And then
there’s also the business of the stuffing of the feelings, and the kinds of
impact that has.
Meichenbaum Commentary: As I reflect what Anna has told me so far,
we’ll begin to develop goals for therapy and set an agenda.
23
Psychotherapy.net
Meichenbaum: I’d like you to start to notice when in fact you’re starting
to have these attacks and when in fact you’re starting to stuff the feelings,
and we’ll be able to talk about that next time.
Anna: Okay. All right.
Meichenbaum: Does that make sense?
Anna: Yeah, yeah, it does.
Meichenbaum Commentary: When a client presents with depression and
marital distress it is critical for the therapist to ensure that the likelihood
of self-injury or injury by the spouse is low. In the latter part of the session,
I administered the Conflict Tactics Scale, the Marital Distress Scale, and
probed for suicide risk. These measures indicated that the risk of self-injury
or injury from others was indeed low. I’ll continue to conduct this assessment
over the course of therapy.
Based on the initial session, two important clinical issues emerge. The
first was to address the nature of Anna’s panic attacks, and to explore it in
some detail and to develop a collaborative treatment plan since these were
having a major impact on her life. Once these panic attacks were brought
under control, we would be able to address the second clinical issue: that
is, the nature and impact of the depression that she was experiencing.
SESSION TWO
Meichenbaum: In order that we can get a feel for what happened—
Meichenbaum Commentary: Following a detailed discussion of the nature
and history of her panic attacks, we considered the worst incident.
Anna: Everyone had just left. The house was hectic that morning, and the
kids had just gone to school, and Patrick finally got off to work. After they
left I had this crying, crying and crying, and then somehow that ended,
and I started to get ready for work. I got into the car.
Meichenbaum: Let me even suggest in order—could I just, in fact, ask you
to sit back in the chair? And in fact, close your eyes?
Meichenbaum Commentary: After exploring Anna’s thoughts and feelings
associated with this incident, I employed an imagery reconstructive procedure
to help her attend to data she might otherwise not recognize. The goal is to 
24
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
help Anna see the interconnection between her thoughts and feelings and
the physical sensations of her panic attacks, especially the impact of her
anticipatory fears.
Meichenbaum: You just left. You had a sigh of relief, and you were getting
ready to—
Anna: Uh-hum. Getting ready to go to work, and I got into the car, and all
of a sudden I felt faint throughout my whole body. And then I got scared,
because I thought, Oh my God, this is going to happen again to me? This
is going to happen again? And I started to breathe very heavily, and my
heart started to race. I thought I was having a heart attack, and I thought,
I’m going to have to go to the emergency room again? I’m not going to
be able to go to work? Or else I’m going to die right here? I felt like I was
suffocating, and I thought, I have to get help. I have to get help. I have to
get out of the car and get somebody to help me. And I felt like everything
was closing in on me.
Meichenbaum: You can really feel that again, right now?
Anna: Yes.
Meichenbaum Commentary: Listen to what Anna says to herself: “Is this
going to happen to me? Am I going to have a heart attack? I’m going to die
right here. I’m suffocating. I have to get help. Everything is closing in.” I want
to help her see that she’s not merely a passive victim of these attacks. Her
catastrophic appraisal of the situation actually exacerbates the panic. If Anna
can learn to appraise both the situation and her ability to cope differently, she
can alter the outcome.
Meichenbaum: There was a situation of when everybody left and you just
had some kind of relief. And then there were the accompanying feelings
that you had.
Meichenbaum Commentary: To help Anna see the interconnection between
triggering events—her feelings, thoughts, and behaviors—I use a visual clock
metaphor, 12:00 being the situation; 3:00, her feelings of apprehension, fear,
and anxiety; 6:00, the automatic catastrophizing thoughts; and 9:00, the
accompanying behaviors of hyperventilation and avoidance.
Meichenbaum: And then there were the thoughts that you had: “Oh my 
25
Psychotherapy.net
God, is it going to happen again? I’m losing control.” And then there is
just not being able to get to work, of going for help, of, “Who am I going to
call?” I mean, as I listen to you it sounds to me as if it’s a kind of—
Anna: Cycle, it’s a vicious cycle.
Meichenbaum: Maybe that’s something we could look at.
Meichenbaum Commentary: With this understanding, we explored ways
that Anna could begin to self-monitor.
Meichenbaum: One of the things I’m going to ask you to do is to note
when in fact you’re having these feelings of anxiety. We’re going to be able
to record the specific kinds of situations when you’re feeling anxious.
Anna: Um-hum.
Meichenbaum: What are the accompanying feelings that you have that
we’ve talked about, when in fact you’re feeling tense and anxious? When
in fact you can feel the hot and cold flashes; when you’re hyperventilating,
the breathing in and out, and then the accompanying thoughts you’re
having of “Oh my God, not again”? So that we can see how this vicious
cycle comes into play.
Meichenbaum Commentary: The initial focus of treatment was to bring
Anna’s panic under control. We would do this by providing Anna with
information about the nature of panic disorder and the role of anticipatory
fear; helping her develop symptom management skills, including noticing
warning signs, interrupting her internal dialogue, diaphragmatic breathing to
control her hyperventilation, and relaxation training; cognitive restructuring
to help control her catastrophic misinterpretation of anxiety symptoms;
graduated exposure to bodily cues that simulate panic attacks; and practice
of coping techniques to regulate them. When the panic was under control our
focus would shift to Anna’s depression.
Initial treatment plan for panic:
· Understand nature of panic disorder and anticipatory fear
· Symptom management skills
· Cognitive restructuring
· Graduated exposure to panic cues
· Practice coping techniques
26
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
SESSION THREE
Anna: All right, there was one time on Tuesday last week when I walked
into Lizzie’s room at 5:00 just to tell her it was time for dinner, and she
started screaming at me about how—
Meichenbaum Commentary: Anna continued to monitor her anxiety,
paying particular attention to her thoughts and feelings as situations
developed.
Meichenbaum: Help me understand in more detail exactly what
happened. You walked into her room, how were you feeling then?
Anna: Well, the feeling was that this is not my fault. This is unfair. It’s not
anything I can do anything about. The thought was that I just can’t do
anything right, ever, in this family.
Meichenbaum: What happened then?
Anna: Well, I just walked out of her room. I could see how I could get
all worked up about it. I could feel these feelings coming on, like a vice
closing in on my chest—
Meichenbaum Commentary: Anna tends to interpret various feelings, in
this case irritation and anger, as tenseness and anxiety, and metaphorically
describe them in physical terms, such as a vice closing on her chest.
Anna: I felt tense in my whole body, but I just held on.
Meichenbaum: Did you have a sense of this kind of, as you described it
before, the racing heart?
Anna: Yes, the racing heart, the breathing, suffocating.
Meichenbaum: But this time, what happened?
Anna: I just walked out of the room.
Meichenbaum Commentary: After reviewing the rest of Anna’s feelings,
thoughts, and behaviors, we focused on her hyperventilation. In order to
regulate the bodily changes that accompany hyperventilation, and to provide
Anna with a personal means of control, she learned to use diaphragmatic
breathing as a coping tool.
Meichenbaum: When people have panic attacks, one of the things that 
27
Psychotherapy.net
happens is they tend to breathe in quickly and exhale out [demonstrates].
That’s what they call hyperventilation. Now when people go through that
kind of breathing in and out, that tends to make them more tense, so
that a lot of the symptoms, the reactions you’re having—the hot and cold
flashes, the feelings of tingling, of feeling dizzy and faint—all of those
symptoms are somehow tied into the way in which you’re breathing, so
that if we could work on learning to control the breathing, then that would
give us one way to break into the vicious cycle that you describe. Could we
take a moment now and just practice some of the relaxation?
Anna: Okay.
Meichenbaum: Good. This will give you a sense of ways that you can
control. So what I’m going to ask you to do is sit back in the chair and get
as comfortable as possible. And then what I’m going to do is ask you to
close your eyes.
Meichenbaum Commentary: After a sequence of tensing and relaxing
various muscle groups, we focused on Anna’s breathing.
Meichenbaum: I’m going to ask you to take a slow, deep breath, filling
the muscles of the chest, holding… holding… And then I’m going to ask
you to slowly let the air out. And as you let it out this time I want you to
imagine you’re blowing on a spoon of hot soup so that you’re not spilling
it. Feel the warmth and calmness. We’ve talked a bit about the way in
which the tenseness contributes to this vicious cycle.
Meichenbaum Commentary: The next step was to focus on the cognitive
aspect of panic attacks, examining Anna’s thoughts in the context of a specific
anecdote.
Meichenbaum: Another piece to this cycle that we talked about were
the kinds of—not only the feelings—but the kinds of thoughts you were
having. And I was wondering if, in order for us both to get a better feel for
that, could we go back to that situation that you described with Lizzie and
look at the kinds of feelings and thoughts you had at each point?
Anna: Okay.
Meichenbaum: Let’s pick up at the point... you had just gone into the
room, and what did she say?
28
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
Anna: Well, she started yelling at me about invading her privacy all the
time, and I thought this was just completely unfair. I didn’t do anything. It
wasn’t right.
Meichenbaum: She was attacking you out of the blue.
Anna: That’s right, and I hadn’t done anything. That’s what I thought.
And then after I walked out of the room I thought, well, I never can do
anything right, never for anybody in this whole family. I’m always wrong,
I’m never right, I’m no good, I’m worthless.
Meichenbaum: And if you have these kinds of thoughts of “I never can
do anything right, I’m unappreciated,” is that part of this cycle?
Anna: Yeah, yeah.
Meichenbaum: There are two aspects of this that I’d like to have us look
at. One is, what it is that you can do to change these thoughts in your
head. The other is, where did these kinds of thoughts and feelings come
from? Let’s start with how we can begin to just break the cycle, and then
we’ll move on to, perhaps, from where those feelings came.
Anna: Okay.
Meichenbaum: Take me back through what those thoughts were.
Anna: Well, at first I thought it was unfair, unfair of her to yell at me.
I didn’t do anything. I just went in there to call her in for dinner. And
then, as I was leaving, I thought, this is the way it always is. I never can do
anything right. I’m always wrong, I’m always wrong, I’m always wrong. I’m
just a total failure.
Meichenbaum Commentary: When Anna offers these automatic thoughts,
we can explore data that is consistent or inconsistent with each automatic
thought. In this way we can help her become an observer of her thought
processes and behaviors and begin to rewrite her story.
Meichenbaum: Is it true that you’re a total failure?
Anna: No, it’s not. Not at all.
Meichenbaum: It’s not.
Anna: No, I’m not.
29
Psychotherapy.net
Meichenbaum: You’re not a total failure.
Anna: Not at all.
Meichenbaum: In what way are you not a total failure?
Meichenbaum Commentary: I’ll challenge Anna to find data that she is not
a failure.
Anna: Well, I’ve done a lot. I had to raise my brother and sister. My father
told me I couldn’t go to school—I was too stupid—and I went anyway. I
paid my own way.
Meichenbaum: You paid your own way.
Anna: Yes. I worked my way through.
Meichenbaum: Uh-huh. Let me check it out. So when your mother died,
right, you had to take care—
Anna: Of my father and the two kids.
Meichenbaum: And you went to school.
Anna: And I went to high school, and my father was drinking and
depressed and mean and told me that I wasn’t smart enough to go to
school. And I wanted to go on to study interior design, but I did anyway.
Meichenbaum: You did it, in spite of what he said.
Anna: Um-hum.
Meichenbaum: Are there other examples that you’re not a total failure?
Anna: Joe is about to go into college, so that’s a good thing.
Meichenbaum: Uh-hum.
Anna: The kids are okay. Lizzie is a big problem right now, but—
Meichenbaum: And what about at work? Are you a total failure there, too?
Anna: No, I’ve been working there for two years.
Meichenbaum: So that the notion that you are a total failure, on the one
hand, does that fit with someone—?
Anna: Who’s done those things?
Meichenbaum: Yeah.
30
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
Anna: Um, I guess not.
Meichenbaum: You guess not.
Anna: You think I should try to say something else to myself?
Meichenbaum: No, well, are you a total failure?
Anna: No, I’m not.
Meichenbaum: You’re not.
Anna: I’m not.
Meichenbaum Commentary: Our discussion of the facts, which are
inconsistent with Anna’s vision of herself as a total failure, has given her a
glimmer of hope. I think that her tears indicate the intensity of this emotion.
Meichenbaum: Huh?
Anna: I do. I mean, I have to try something, because I can’t go on like this.
Meichenbaum: So that the notion that you are a total failure, that you’re
worthless, that you’re a nobody, does that fit the data of who Anna is?
Anna: No.
Meichenbaum Commentary: At this point, I decide to help Anna appreciate
that her feelings were normal and appropriate, given her experience with her
father and her relationship with Patrick, to validate her reactions.
Meichenbaum: The tears that I see?
Anna: Yeah?
Meichenbaum: The welling up?
Anna: Uh-huh?
Meichenbaum: Are signs of how much you’re in touch with your feelings.
Meichenbaum Commentary: Perhaps it would have been better to help
Anna put into words the feelings behind the tears before rushing to validate
her experience.
In the next three sessions, we were able to use a variety of cognitive behavioral
procedures in order to help Anna develop some control over her panic
attacks. She was able to use diaphragmatic breathing in order to control 
31
Psychotherapy.net
the hyperventilation and to handle the anticipatory fear that she was
experiencing. We used self-instructional training procedures in order to
combat her tendency to misinterpret bodily signs and to catastrophize. We
also employed simulated panic attacks in the clinic so that she could learn
and use various kinds of coping techniques. Anna was also encouraged to use
these kinds of coping skills everyday in the form of personal experiments.
SESSION SEVEN
Anna: Well, I didn’t have any attacks this week, and—
Meichenbaum Commentary: By the seventh session, Anna reported that she
had been able to use coping techniques to manage her anxiety.
Anna: Well, there was one time this week, again with Lizzie, where she
got some mail that was done something to or opened by the post office
or something, and she came screaming at me again that I had opened her
mail and invaded her privacy, and I started to get those feelings of—
Meichenbaum: What kinds of feelings did you start to get?
Anna: Well, I started to get anxious and tense and I couldn’t breathe and I
can’t do anything right. I can’t do anything—
Meichenbaum: What happened this time?
Anna: Well, I started to breathe. I made myself become aware of my
breathing. I forced myself to take deep breaths.
Meichenbaum: Fill me in. What did you do?
Anna: Well, I just started to breathe and concentrate on the breathing.
Meichenbaum Commentary: I’ll focus heavily on the ways in which she
interrupted this incipient panic attack in order to reinforce this new pattern.
Later, I’d like to explore her sensitivity to her daughter’s criticisms.
Meichenbaum: What happened when you heard that—
Anna: Well, I heard that a couple of times and I thought, I have to change
this, so I just said to myself, I said, “This isn’t my fault. I didn’t do this.”
Meichenbaum: You mean, open the letter for Liz.
Anna: Right. I didn’t do this. It isn’t my fault.
32
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
Meichenbaum: And when you said that to yourself, what happened? How
did that make you feel?
Anna: Well, um, it seemed to kind of relax me in a way, with the breathing
and the—
Meichenbaum: Anna, are you saying that you actually could notice when
you were getting worked up?
Anna: Yeah, I did, because—
Meichenbaum: And did you sort of catch yourself and interrupt it this
time?
Anna: Um-hum, I did.
Meichenbaum: What did you say this time that was different?
Anna: I said it wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t my fault. I didn’t do anything
wrong.
Meichenbaum: And when you repeated that to yourself, how did that help
you?
Anna: Well, it seemed to kind of go away.
Meichenbaum Commentary: It’s not only important for clients to change,
they must also take credit for the change, and see the instrumental actions
they took to bring about that change.
Anna: The physical didn’t happen. I guess, I guess it just stopped. It didn’t
happen.
Meichenbaum: What you did about noticing and the way in which you
can sort of catch yourself, and this kind of thing, are there ways to do this
with people at home? Is there any way to do what you did with Liz, say,
with Patrick?
Anna: Oh. Um, well, I don’t know.
Meichenbaum: When I asked about Patrick, you sort of looked away. Tell
me a little bit about Patrick and you, and how you’re getting on with each
other.
Anna: Well, not too good lately, actually. Um, I guess it’s been since I’ve gone
to work. The past couple of years, things have been getting more difficult.
33
Psychotherapy.net
Meichenbaum: So that when you went to work—
Anna: I guess that’s when the tension started to come in.
Meichenbaum: Hm, that’s interesting. What do you think was going on
with you going to work and the tension increasing? What happened?
Anna: Well, I don’t know. Maybe I was finding some independence. Maybe
he resents that.
Meichenbaum: What gives you the notion that somehow the
independence and resentment go together? Has Patrick ever said anything
to you about the work?
Anna: No, he hasn’t. He just is kind of belittling, you know, about it. But
he hasn’t really said anything.
Meichenbaum: So he belittles the work?
Anna: Oh, he makes fun of it. “Your little job,” he calls it, “your little job.”
Meichenbaum: And when he calls it that “little job,” how does that make
you feel?
Anna: Um, it makes me mad.
Meichenbaum: What, does he have the big job and you have the little job?
Anna: Yeah.
Meichenbaum: Hum?
Anna: Yeah, I think so.
Meichenbaum Commentary: At this point, we discuss whether Anna
would find it useful to invite Patrick to join us for a session, and whether she
should consider couples therapy. Anna was quite firm that she looked upon
our therapy meetings as her time and didn’t want to include Patrick, at least
not at this point. The discussion then turned toward her developmental
background and the relationship with her father.
Meichenbaum: Have there been other people in your life who have also, as
you’ve described it, belittled you?
Anna: Um…
Meichenbaum: Criticized you like that?
34
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
Anna: Well, Patrick’s been the person in my life for the past 18 years.
Meichenbaum: What about before Patrick? Were there—
Anna: Um… well, I guess my father. He was like that to me, too.
Meichenbaum: He also—
Anna: Belittled me, yes.
Meichenbaum: Criticized you?
Anna: Yes.
Meichenbaum: Sarcastic?
Anna: Um-hum. Cold.
Meichenbaum: Told you, you couldn’t go on? Cold?
Anna: Right. Told me I couldn’t go to school. I wasn’t smart enough to go
on to school.
Meichenbaum: Then perhaps it would be useful for us to sort of talk about
what went on then? What was the impact?
Meichenbaum Commentary: With this discussion we began to uncover
Anna’s story of how her core schemas, or beliefs—that she is worthless and
a total failure—had developed, and how she learned to engage in depressive
forms of thinking, such as seeing things as black or white, and magnifying
negative events.
In the eighth session, Anna continued to discuss the relationship she had with
her father and its ongoing impact. She was able to put into words, perhaps for
the first time, her anger toward him.
SESSION NINE
Anna: Well, it’s been better this week, I think. I haven’t had any panic
attacks. But I don’t know why I feel kind of worse, actually.
Meichenbaum: Worse in what way?
Anna: Well, more depressed. I’ve been thinking about a lot of things, and
it just kind of makes me feel terrible.
Meichenbaum: What kinds of things have you been—?
35
Psychotherapy.net
Anna: Well, like, we’ve talked, and I’ve been trying to think about my
father and that time of my life, and why I’m depressed now, and I haven’t
been then, or in the past many years. Why now am I having these attacks
and these depressions?
Meichenbaum: You mentioned something in one of our earlier sessions
that this was the time now—how did you put it? This is the time that your
daughter was the age of—
Anna: Oh, that’s right. I was my daughter’s age when my mother died of
cancer.
Meichenbaum: Just about this time?
Anna: Exactly. I was 13, just like Lizzie is now.
Meichenbaum: What was it like back then when you were 13?
Anna: My father was depressed and drinking a lot. He had been drinking
before my mother died, but not as much as now. He had always been
kind of mean to my mom. Like, there were a lot of fights, and he had an
explosive personality. He never hit her or anything like that, but there were
a lot of fights. He was mean, sarcastic.
Meichenbaum: And you would see this?
Anna: Yeah, I would see it. Mostly I could hear it a lot. I’d listen to it. I’d
be lying in bed at night, listening to these fights. I’d always lie there, and
I wish she had more fight to her. I wish she would just stand up and have
some guts. I always wished she had some moxie.
Meichenbaum: What did you see in your mom?
Meichenbaum Commentary: I want to explore whether Anna sees any
positive characteristics in her mother.
Anna: It always made me feel very sad and depressed for her. I don’t know.
I just wish she could stand up to him.
Meichenbaum: What could she have done?
Anna: Hmm, I don’t know what she really could have done, being the
kind of man he was. I don’t know. Um, I guess she did the best she could.
She kind of stood between him and us, when she was alive. She kept the
barriers there. I think if it hadn’t been for her, he probably would have 
36
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
come after us that way.
Meichenbaum: So she was—you use the word “barrier” between you
and—
Anna: Yeah. He would yell at her and not at us. He didn’t ever yell at the
little kids. When she died he would yell at me. Kind of, I took the place of
her.
Meichenbaum: When you did that, when you took the place of her—
Anna: Yeah, after she died?
Meichenbaum: What kind of impact did it have on you?
Anna: Well, um, I just kind of took it all in, and kept busy, and took care
of the kids, and went on about my business, and—
Meichenbaum Commentary: Perhaps we can help Anna appreciate the rest
of her story.
Meichenbaum: Was there any way that you acted as a barrier?
Meichenbaum Commentary: She was more than just a dumped on
daughter. She was also a protective sister.
Anna: Well, yeah, I guess. I kind of took in all his stuff, and he could yell
at me and tell me I was a total failure, and then he left them alone.
Meichenbaum Commentary: It’s interesting to note Anna’s comment that
she took in all her father’s stuff, in light of her metaphor of “stuffing” her own
feelings.
Meichenbaum: In that way, are you in any way like your mom?
Anna: Well, there was one time that, I don’t know, I had done something.
I can’t even remember what it was; I just remember the situation that he
told me I was just stubborn. I was just so stubborn. And she took me aside
and she said, “No.” She said, “Don’t listen to him. You’re not stubborn.
You’re tenacious. That’s what you are.”
Meichenbaum: Tenacious?
Anna: Uh-hmm. That’s what she said. So I guess in a way she was more
than a barrier against him. She was really a wonderful person. I wish you
could have known her.
37
Psychotherapy.net
Meichenbaum: She was really special.
Anna: Yeah, she was. I guess she just knew things about me. That’s kind of
why I miss her so much.
Meichenbaum: Especially at this time?
Anna: Yeah.
Meichenbaum: There seems to be a coincidence between when your mom
died, when you were 13, and the age that your daughter’s at. That kind of
timing might help us better understand about… You said you didn’t quite
grieve the loss of your mom.
Anna: Hmm. No.
Meichenbaum: Is it possible that somehow the panic attacks, these attacks
that you’re having, especially at this time, isn’t something tied to that same
grieving process?
Anna: I hadn’t really thought about it like that. But actually, well, the
attacks… Well, this is kind of strange, they really kind of started on
Lizzie’s 13th birthday. I guess there is a strong connection to that.
Meichenbaum: And if you could find some other way to grieve for your
mom, if you could find some other way to take that person you cared for
so much and so deeply for, the special relationship you had with her, if you
could find a way, besides the depression, besides the anxiety, the concern
that you have, would that help?
Meichenbaum Commentary: These questions would soon enlarge to, Could
Anna learn to have her own voice, write her own script, instead of repeating
the script authored by her father and by Patrick?
SESSION 10
Anna: Um, there was something that happened with Patrick that was kind
of surprising to me, actually.
Meichenbaum: Oh, really? What happened?
Anna: Well, it was on Saturday. Everybody was busy. It was hectic, as
usual, and he had done some work, met with some clients, even though
it was Saturday. And he came in acting very important. He had so many 
38
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
things to do. And he just kind of brushed me off, and I started to get really
angry again, and feel those feelings. And I waited until he got off the
phone, and I went into the room, and I went up to him and I said, “Patrick,
you are such an asshole.”
Meichenbaum: [laughing a little]
Anna: And I never use any language like that with him, at all, with
anybody.
Meichenbaum: And what happened?
Anna: I don’t think he knew whether to be angry or shocked or what. So
he just kind of ignored it. The funny thing about it is that the rest of the
day we kind of had a, we had a really nice time, and we went out that night.
Meichenbaum: So it takes calling him an asshole to get that kind of
reaction?
[Laughter]
Anna: I hope not. But it seemed like in this situation it kind of got a
reaction that I wouldn’t expect. I mean, I wouldn’t expect it from myself,
either.
Meichenbaum: So on the one hand, when the feelings build—
Anna: I could take them all in and turn them against myself, but in this
case, I just, I guess I turned them against him.
Meichenbaum: Yeah. So sometimes you just stuff them, stuff them down.
And sometimes it comes out?
Anna: Well this time it came out. “Patrick, you are such an asshole.”
Meichenbaum: Could you believe you said that?
Anna: No.
[Laughter]
Meichenbaum: Huh?
[Laughter]
Anna: No.
Meichenbaum: How’d you feel about saying that?
39
Psychotherapy.net
Anna: Well, when I said it I was angry. I was beginning to get anxious. But
then after, I stormed out of the room—I said that to him and I stormed
out of the room—and I got back into the kitchen and I waited to see if
there was a reaction, and there wasn’t. I guess I kind of thought it was
funny. But I certainly felt the tension go. I felt like yelling at everyone.
Meichenbaum: Hmm, what, you have a backlog of people?
[Laughter]
Anna: Lizzie, Joe…
[Laughter]
Meichenbaum: All these assholes, you want to kick around, huh? Huh?
Anna: I guess.
Meichenbaum: What, you keep a list? Huh? Let’s take a moment and see
what you could do besides stuff it down versus explode and call people
assholes [laughter]. What could someone do besides… what’s in the
middle? What’s the gray area? What do people do with their feelings?
Anna: What else could I have done, Dr. Meichenbaum? What would a
normal person do?
Meichenbaum Commentary: The rest of this session was devoted to
discussing and practicing assertiveness skills that Anna could use in place of
either aggressive confrontations or stuffing her feelings.
Anna: I should have you tell him. You say it better than me.
Meichenbaum: Let’s try and see if you could say it. Could you imagine
that I was Patrick, and that this was that Saturday?
Anna: I could try.
Meichenbaum: I’ve just been on the phone. I’ve walked through. I’ve just
given you orders. I’ve asked you questions and I’ve walked away. And now,
what are you going to say?
Anna: “Patrick, I’m tired of you ignoring me all the time. I think you
should stop.”
Meichenbaum: If I say, “Anna, you did this. You did this,” how will that
make you feel if I kept telling you, “You did it. You did this?”
40
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
Anna: Hmm… guilty.
Meichenbaum: Is that going to make you a sympathetic listener?
Anna: No.
SESSION 11
Anna: Well, it was a pretty normal week, but there was one incident this
week that I was able to try to use the skills that we talked about.
Meichenbaum: What happened?
Anna: Well, I was at work, and I had ordered a tapestry to be delivered to
a client for a showing. And the tapestry didn’t get there. I was very clear
about the directions and where they were supposed to be and what time,
and it just didn’t make it in time for the showing. So the clients got very
angry and came back to the boss and yelled at him, and the boss came and
yelled at me.
Meichenbaum: And then what happened, when they yelled at you?
Anna: Well, I took it all in, and the boss went back into the room, and
I started to get very upset, and I thought, well, this is the time when I
could try to use what we talked about last week. So I thought about it for a
minute and I went into the boss’ room, and I said, “You know, um, when
something like this happens and you yell at me it makes me feel very bad,
and it’s not any kind of way to work, because this just wasn’t my fault.
Everything I did about getting the tapestry there was right. It wasn’t my
fault, and you really have no right to yell at me about that, and I don’t
think it’s a good way to work.”
Meichenbaum: You told him that?
Anna: Yeah, I did. I did.
Meichenbaum: And what happened after you told him?
Anna: Well, by that time he had kind of calmed down a little, and so I
think he understood.
Meichenbaum: How did that make you feel, that you could take it in, sit
out there, and then decide to go in and—
Anna: Well, actually the amazing thing is that he kind of apologized for 
41
Psychotherapy.net
yelling at me like that. And it made me feel really good.
Meichenbaum Commentary: I’ll help Anna to use the data from her
personal experiments as evidence to unfreeze the beliefs she holds about
herself and the world.
Anna: Well, I felt kind of proud that I had taken a situation into my hands
and acted upon it.
Meichenbaum: Are you saying that you could actually notice when you’re
starting to simmer, take it in, stuff it down? That you could actually notice
that happening?
Anna: Yes, yeah, I could notice those situations, and I think sometimes
I can even begin to, like in this case, I can start to notice those situations
even before they begin.
Meichenbaum: Hmm.
Meichenbaum Commentary: In addition to taking ownership of her
changes, Anna also needs to be able to describe the process that led to such
change. Note her self-directing language: “taking the situation into my
hands,” “acted upon it,” “start to notice before it begins.”
Anna: Well, I did consciously try to make an effort to talk about, to go and
confront the person with what had happened.
Meichenbaum: Are you saying that you’re in the process of finding the
middle ground? That there’s something besides just stuffing it down versus
exploding or withdrawing?
Anna: Um-hmm. Yeah, I guess, I guess I am saying that.
Meichenbaum: Were there any other instances of when this occurred?
Anna: No, this was the time that I had done it this week. I know we had
talked about doing it with Patrick. I didn’t try it with Patrick yet.
Meichenbaum: Yet?
Anna: Yet.
Meichenbaum: What does that mean, “Yet”?
Meichenbaum Commentary: I chose to latch onto Anna’s use of the word
“yet” to elicit a commitment statement and reinforce the hopefulness that she 
42
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
would try her skills with Patrick.
Anna: I really think I could maybe try it with Patrick.
Meichenbaum: You could try what? The—
Anna: This—
Meichenbaum: Telling him how you feel?
Anna: —talking. Yeah.
Meichenbaum: Instead of the stuffing?
Anna: Yeah.
Meichenbaum: Instead of the exploding and withdrawing?
Anna: Yeah. I think I’d like to try it with Patrick.
Meichenbaum: It might take some courage, huh?
Anna: Oh, yeah.
Meichenbaum: Hmm?
Anna: Yeah, I didn’t have the courage to do it this week.
Meichenbaum: And what’s going to be different about next week?
Anna: Well, I did it once with the boss.
Meichenbaum: And how did it turn out?
Anna: It turned out well.
Meichenbaum: So you think you’re getting close to that point?
Anna: I think I actually would like to try it with Patrick.
Meichenbaum: What might get in the way of you trying this?
Meichenbaum Commentary: I’m anticipating any possible obstacles to
Anna’s following through on what we’ve discussed.
Meichenbaum: Barriers or obstacles that you can envision? Anything that
might convince you not to try it?
Anna: Not to try it?
Meichenbaum: Yeah. You think you could actually go ahead and do it?
Anna: I think I could, yeah.
43
Psychotherapy.net
Meichenbaum: Okay.
Anna: Okay.
Meichenbaum: I’m eager to see what happens. I suspect you are, too.
Anna: Me, too.
Meichenbaum: What if you try these kinds of things with people—with
your boss, with Patrick—and it doesn’t work?
Meichenbaum Commentary: The next step was to engage in relapse
prevention by having Anna anticipate and prepare for possible setbacks. Not
all of Anna’s personal experiments will work, and we want to decrease the
likelihood that she will catastrophize, sliding back into her black or white,
depressive-thinking pattern.
In the remainder of the session, I explored with Anna how does it feel to relate
differently, no longer in an anxious and depressive fashion? We explored what
were the conclusions she can now draw about herself given this new style of
interacting? What did her mother mean when she said that she was tenacious?
Was she right? An exploration of these questions would help Anna to begin to
rewrite the script to construct a new narrative. Given the progress that she was
making in this area, I suggested that we take two weeks between now and the
next session, so she could continue practicing some of her coping skills.
SESSION 12
Meichenbaum: Anna, it has now been two weeks since I’ve seen you last.
I was wondering if you could fill me in on how things have gone these last
weeks.
Anna: Well, actually they’ve been a little better.
Meichenbaum: Hmm. Fill me in. In what way?
Anna: Well, there were a couple of incidents this week that I think went
differently, one with Patrick. Patrick and I had a plan to have dinner
together. The kids were gone that night. And I rushed home from work
early to make dinner, and he, again, came breezing in about an hour late
and said, “Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot. We’ll have to do it some other time.” I
started to feel really badly about that, and I started to walk upstairs, and
I thought—I don’t know what I thought. But then I decided to go and tell 
44
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
Patrick. So I went to him and I said, “You know, Patrick, when we have
a plan, and you just kind of breeze through and blow me off like that, it
makes me feel really bad. I feel really kind of awful about it.” And you
know, for once he really heard that. He was really listening, and apologized
to me for doing that.
Meichenbaum: And did you end up having your dinner?
Anna: Yeah, we did. And we talked a little. It turned out to be a nice
evening.
Meichenbaum: Hmm… How’d that make you feel?
Anna: Well, it made me feel really good.
Meichenbaum: That you told him?
Anna: That I told him, yeah.
Meichenbaum: And that he heard you?
Anna: Yeah. That he really listened and he seemed to take it in.
Meichenbaum: So you are finding that middle ground.
Anna: I guess. I guess I am.
Meichenbaum: You’re finding that you don’t have to stuff it.
Anna: Yeah, yeah, in that case. I found that I didn’t… that it was
much better, it felt much better, to work up the whatever, moxie, to say
something to Patrick instead of just stuff it or let it go by.
Meichenbaum: You mentioned that that was one incident with Patrick.
When you started off you said there were a couple of incidents. I’m kind of
curious what else has happened. It sound like a—
Anna: Well, there was one other one. I don’t know if it’s the same kind of
thing, but with Lizzie, this week. I was thinking about my mom a lot this
week, and one evening I took out all the old pictures of all the relatives,
and a lot of pictures of my mom. And I saw a picture from her wedding
that I hadn’t seen in a long time. And so I was just looking at it, trying to
imagine about my mom at that time in her life, and Lizzie, I guess, walked
by the room and saw me looking very strange, and so she came in and
wanted to know what was going on. And I had just discovered this picture,
or rediscovered it, and I was able to explain a little to Lizzie about her 
45
Psychotherapy.net
grandmother, my mother; what she was like.
Meichenbaum: And how did she receive all that?
Anna: Well, actually, she was a lot more interested than I thought she
would be. And we spent the rest of that evening talking about my mother.
Meichenbaum: You mean the whole evening, with Lizzie?
Anna: Yeah, actually. It made me feel good to be giving something of my
mother to her, giving something of my life to her that she seemed to need.
Meichenbaum: It sounds like it was a very special moment.
Anna: It was, actually.
Meichenbaum: As I listen to you describe these incidents with Patrick,
the sharing with Liz, I’m struck with these incidents as compared to what
you were like when you first came in. Can you think back to those first
sessions?
Anna: Oh, yeah. I can.
Meichenbaum: When you were the “glob of misery,” the “personal
tragedy”?
Meichenbaum Commentary: It is useful to contrast Anna’s present level of
functioning with what she was like when she first came in. Clients sometimes
lose perspective of the nature and degree of change that they have brought
about.
Meichenbaum: The person who had the panic attacks and the depression?
Anna: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm.
Meichenbaum: Do you see those differences? Am I misreading it?
Anna: No, not at all. I can definitely see some differences in the person I
was then and the person I am now.
Meichenbaum: What is it that you’ve taken away from the sessions? What
has happened in your life that has led to these kinds of changes?
Anna: Well, um, I guess one of the things is that now I can begin to see
when one of these attacks is coming on, is forming, and I can maybe
change what I’m thinking, or the voice that’s running through my head
into something else to make it stop or get control of it. When I’m starting 
46
MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION
to feel like I have the choice of stuffing the feeling or not, I can try to talk
to somebody, talk to the person about it—tell about it—and that will help
me to get it out in another way than stuffing it.
Meichenbaum: And you also, you use the word “the voice,” or something
that was going on—
Anna: Voice.
Meichenbaum: In what way has that voice changed? In what way has the
CD that you described changed from where you began?
Anna: Well, I can change it. I don’t think it has really changed, but when I
hear it I can change it and make it play a different voice, a different thing
to say. I can change it into my voice.
