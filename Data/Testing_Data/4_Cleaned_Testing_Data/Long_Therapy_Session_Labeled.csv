"Oh, of course.",0
"Lately I’ve been having these attacks that are keeping me from functioning. My heart starts racing. I feel like I’m suffocating, and I just focus in on—and, uh…",0
"Well, it becomes a total preoccupation. I can’t think about anything else but this attack. My heart starts beating, my blood starts racing. I feel like I’m going to die. I’ve been to the emergency room three times already.",1
"Patrick—that’s my husband—he was late, he lost his car keys, it was a madhouse, and after they all got out I just started crying. I couldn’t stop. I was uncontrollably crying.",1
"Well, somehow I finally got myself together and I started to get ready to go to work, and then I got to the car and I just froze up. My heart started to race. I had feelings up and down my arm. I thought I was going to pass out. I knew I had to get to the emergency room so I called Patrick, and he was too angry. He told me if I thought I needed to go to an emergency room, I should call someone else. So I called my son, Joe and got him out of school to take me—I was so embarrassed—and we went to this emergency room and saw someone, and the doctor came out and said there was nothing wrong with my heart.",1
"Well, I knew there was something wrong with me. I mean, these were very physical feelings, racing up and down my arm, my heart beating like that. He suggested I see a psychiatrist.",1
"Yeah, I did. Well, the next day they did a battery of tests and I saw that the results of that were all negative. And I saw a psychiatrist the next day. He gave me some medication and it helped for a little while, but—",0
I don’t know. I think it was for depression.,0
"Well, I guess all my whole life I’ve kind of battled with bouts of depression.",0
"Like right now. Patrick is a lawyer and he’s busy all the time. People look up to him. My son Joe, he’s a teenager and busy. And Lizzie is entering that early adolescent stage where everything I do is wrong. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her. I just have these feelings of being completely worthless. I’m just, like, hopeless. I have no hope about anything.",1
"Yeah, well, it’s like, my whole life is just a big glob of misery. It’s just a total personal tragedy.",1
"Well, you might find this interesting. When my daughter was my age—I mean, when I was my daughter’s age—my mother died of cancer, and I felt like my whole life was over. I loved her so much, and I think what it would be like now if—",1
Yeah.,0
What it would be like for my daughter.,0
"Yeah, I was just 13.",0
"Well, I think about what I had to do back then. I was the oldest of three and I had to take care of my father, and my brother and my sister.",0
"Well, my father was very depressed and drinking a lot during that time, and he—so I had to take care of him. And I had to get up first in the morning and I had to get breakfast for them, my brother and sister. I had to wake up my father, which was very hard, and get him ready for work, and then I had to get myself ready to go, too. I had to make lunches for everybody, and during my lunch hour, I’d have to go and check on the kids sometimes.",0
"You see, in my family, we never dealt with these feelings. We just kind of stuffed them all down.",0
"Oh, yeah.",0
"Well, he was missing my mom, and I understood that. But I was the oldest, and he ended up taking it out on me.",0
"Oh, he would make jokes like I was too stupid to… I wanted to go to college—",1
I had a lot of responsibilities. I was taking care of—,0
"Yes, he would belittle—he would—I would say he would belittle me. And then I would get upset and he’d say, “Oh, I was only joking.” So—",0
"Oh, it would make me feel awful, because you can’t really get mad at a joke. I just kind of took all the—I was confused—I took all those feelings and I just stuffed them down.",0
"Um, Patrick kind of has that edge of criticism too, sometimes.",0
"Well, I suppose it makes me very angry, and that I’m told it’s just a, “Oh, I was just joking,” or something like that, and then—",0
I just stuff them down. I just don’t deal with them.,0
I don’t know.,0
Okay.,0
Uh-hum.,0
Okay. All right.,0
"Yeah, yeah, it does.",0
"Everyone had just left. The house was hectic that morning, and the kids had just gone to school, and Patrick finally got off to work. After they left I had this crying, crying and crying, and then somehow that ended, and I started to get ready for work. I got into the car.",0
"Uh-hum. Getting ready to go to work, and I got into the car, and all of a sudden I felt faint throughout my whole body. And then I got scared, because I thought, Oh my God, this is going to happen again to me? This is going to happen again? And I started to breathe very heavily, and my heart started to race. I thought I was having a heart attack, and I thought, I’m going to have to go to the emergency room again? I’m not going to be able to go to work? Or else I’m going to die right here? I felt like I was suffocating, and I thought, I have to get help. I have to get help. I have to get out of the car and get somebody to help me. And I felt like everything was closing in on me.",1
Yes.,0
"Cycle, it’s a vicious cycle.",0
Um-hum.,0
"All right, there was one time on Tuesday last week when I walked into Lizzie’s room at 5:00 just to tell her it was time for dinner, and she started screaming at me about how—",0
"Well, the feeling was that this is not my fault. This is unfair. It’s not anything I can do anything about. The thought was that I just can’t do anything right, ever, in this family.",1
"Well, I just walked out of her room. I could see how I could get all worked up about it. I could feel these feelings coming on, like a vice closing in on my chest—",1
"I felt tense in my whole body, but I just held on.",0
"Yes, the racing heart, the breathing, suffocating.",0
I just walked out of the room.,0
Okay.,0
Okay.,0
"Well, she started yelling at me about invading her privacy all the time, and I thought this was just completely unfair. I didn’t do anything. It wasn’t right.",1
"That’s right, and I hadn’t done anything. That’s what I thought. And then after I walked out of the room I thought, well, I never can do anything right, never for anybody in this whole family. I’m always wrong, I’m never right, I’m no good, I’m worthless.",1
"Yeah, yeah.",0
Okay.,0
"Well, at first I thought it was unfair, unfair of her to yell at me. I didn’t do anything. I just went in there to call her in for dinner. And then, as I was leaving, I thought, this is the way it always is. I never can do anything right. I’m always wrong, I’m always wrong, I’m always wrong. I’m just a total failure.",1
"No, it’s not. Not at all.",0
"No, I’m not.",0
Not at all.,0
"Well, I’ve done a lot. I had to raise my brother and sister. My father told me I couldn’t go to school—I was too stupid—and I went anyway. I paid my own way.",1
Yes. I worked my way through.,0
Of my father and the two kids.,0
"And I went to high school, and my father was drinking and depressed and mean and told me that I wasn’t smart enough to go to school. And I wanted to go on to study interior design, but I did anyway.",1
Um-hum.,0
"Joe is about to go into college, so that’s a good thing.",0
"The kids are okay. Lizzie is a big problem right now, but—",0
"No, I’ve been working there for two years.",0
Who’s done those things?,0
"Um, I guess not.",0
You think I should try to say something else to myself?,0
"No, I’m not.",0
I’m not.,0
"I do. I mean, I have to try something, because I can’t go on like this.",1
No.,0
Yeah?,0
Uh-huh?,0
"Well, I didn’t have any attacks this week, and—",0
"Well, there was one time this week, again with Lizzie, where she got some mail that was done something to or opened by the post office or something, and she came screaming at me again that I had opened her mail and invaded her privacy, and I started to get those feelings of—",1
"Well, I started to get anxious and tense and I couldn’t breathe and I can’t do anything right. I can’t do anything—",1
"Well, I started to breathe. I made myself become aware of my breathing. I forced myself to take deep breaths.",0
"Well, I just started to breathe and concentrate on the breathing.",0
"Well, I heard that a couple of times and I thought, I have to change this, so I just said to myself, I said, “This isn’t my fault. I didn’t do this.”",0
Right. I didn’t do this. It isn’t my fault.,0
"Well, um, it seemed to kind of relax me in a way, with the breathing and the—",0
"Yeah, I did, because—",0
"Um-hum, I did.",0
I said it wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t my fault. I didn’t do anything wrong.,0
"Well, it seemed to kind of go away.",0
"The physical didn’t happen. I guess, I guess it just stopped. It didn’t happen.",0
"Oh. Um, well, I don’t know.",0
"Well, not too good lately, actually. Um, I guess it’s been since I’ve gone to work. The past couple of years, things have been getting more difficult.",0
I guess that’s when the tension started to come in.,0
"Well, I don’t know. Maybe I was finding some independence. Maybe he resents that.",0
"No, he hasn’t. He just is kind of belittling, you know, about it. But he hasn’t really said anything.",0
"Oh, he makes fun of it. “Your little job,” he calls it, “your little job.”",1
"Um, it makes me mad.",0
Yeah.,0
"Yeah, I think so.",0
Um…,0
"Well, Patrick’s been the person in my life for the past 18 years.",0
"Um… well, I guess my father. He was like that to me, too.",0
"Belittled me, yes.",0
Yes.,0
Um-hum. Cold.,0
Right. Told me I couldn’t go to school. I wasn’t smart enough to go on to school.,1
"Well, it’s been better this week, I think. I haven’t had any panic attacks. But I don’t know why I feel kind of worse, actually.",0
"Well, more depressed. I’ve been thinking about a lot of things, and it just kind of makes me feel terrible.",1
"Well, like, we’ve talked, and I’ve been trying to think about my father and that time of my life, and why I’m depressed now, and I haven’t been then, or in the past many years. Why now am I having these attacks and these depressions?",1
"Oh, that’s right. I was my daughter’s age when my mother died of cancer.",0
"Exactly. I was 13, just like Lizzie is now.",0
"My father was depressed and drinking a lot. He had been drinking before my mother died, but not as much as now. He had always been kind of mean to my mom. Like, there were a lot of fights, and he had an explosive personality. He never hit her or anything like that, but there were a lot of fights. He was mean, sarcastic.",0
"Yeah, I would see it. Mostly I could hear it a lot. I’d listen to it. I’d be lying in bed at night, listening to these fights. I’d always lie there, and I wish she had more fight to her. I wish she would just stand up and have some guts. I always wished she had some moxie.",0
It always made me feel very sad and depressed for her. I don’t know. I just wish she could stand up to him.,1
"Hmm, I don’t know what she really could have done, being the kind of man he was. I don’t know. Um, I guess she did the best she could. She kind of stood between him and us, when she was alive. She kept the barriers there. I think if it hadn’t been for her, he probably would have 36 MIXED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION come after us that way.",0
"Yeah. He would yell at her and not at us. He didn’t ever yell at the little kids. When she died he would yell at me. Kind of, I took the place of her.",0
"Yeah, after she died?",0
"Well, um, I just kind of took it all in, and kept busy, and took care of the kids, and went on about my business, and—",0
"Well, yeah, I guess. I kind of took in all his stuff, and he could yell at me and tell me I was a total failure, and then he left them alone.",1
"Well, there was one time that, I don’t know, I had done something. I can’t even remember what it was; I just remember the situation that he told me I was just stubborn. I was just so stubborn. And she took me aside and she said, “No.” She said, “Don’t listen to him. You’re not stubborn. You’re tenacious. That’s what you are.”",0
Uh-hmm. That’s what she said. So I guess in a way she was more than a barrier against him. She was really a wonderful person. I wish you could have known her.,0
"Yeah, she was. I guess she just knew things about me. That’s kind of why I miss her so much.",0
Yeah.,0
Hmm. No.,0
"I hadn’t really thought about it like that. But actually, well, the attacks… Well, this is kind of strange, they really kind of started on Lizzie’s 13th birthday. I guess there is a strong connection to that.",1
"Um, there was something that happened with Patrick that was kind of surprising to me, actually.",0
"Well, it was on Saturday. Everybody was busy. It was hectic, as usual, and he had done some work, met with some clients, even though it was Saturday. And he came in acting very important. He had so many things to do. And he just kind of brushed me off, and I started to get really angry again, and feel those feelings. And I waited until he got off the phone, and I went into the room, and I went up to him and I said, “Patrick, you are such an asshole.”",1
"And I never use any language like that with him, at all, with anybody.",0
"I don’t think he knew whether to be angry or shocked or what. So he just kind of ignored it. The funny thing about it is that the rest of the day we kind of had a, we had a really nice time, and we went out that night.",0
"I hope not. But it seemed like in this situation it kind of got a reaction that I wouldn’t expect. I mean, I wouldn’t expect it from myself, either.",0
"I could take them all in and turn them against myself, but in this case, I just, I guess I turned them against him.",0
"Well this time it came out. “Patrick, you are such an asshole.”",1
No. [Laughter],0
No.,0
"Well, when I said it I was angry. I was beginning to get anxious. But then after, I stormed out of the room—I said that to him and I stormed out of the room—and I got back into the kitchen and I waited to see if there was a reaction, and there wasn’t. I guess I kind of thought it was funny. But I certainly felt the tension go. I felt like yelling at everyone.",1
"Lizzie, Joe… [Laughter]",0
I guess.,0
"What else could I have done, Dr. Meichenbaum? What would a normal person do?",0
I should have you tell him. You say it better than me.,0
I could try.,0
"“Patrick, I’m tired of you ignoring me all the time. I think you should stop.”",1
Hmm… guilty.,0
"Well, it was a pretty normal week, but there was one incident this week that I was able to try to use the skills that we talked about.",0
"Well, I was at work, and I had ordered a tapestry to be delivered to a client for a showing. And the tapestry didn’t get there. I was very clear about the directions and where they were supposed to be and what time, and it just didn’t make it in time for the showing. So the clients got very angry and came back to the boss and yelled at him, and the boss came and yelled at me.",0
"Well, I took it all in, and the boss went back into the room, and I started to get very upset, and I thought, well, this is the time when I could try to use what we talked about last week. So I thought about it for a minute and I went into the boss’ room, and I said, “You know, um, when something like this happens and you yell at me it makes me feel very bad, and it’s not any kind of way to work, because this just wasn’t my fault. Everything I did about getting the tapestry there was right. It wasn’t my fault, and you really have no right to yell at me about that, and I don’t think it’s a good way to work.”",0
"Yeah, I did. I did.",0
"Well, by that time he had kind of calmed down a little, and so I think he understood.",0
"Well, actually the amazing thing is that he kind of apologized for yelling at me like that. And it made me feel really good.",0
"Well, I felt kind of proud that I had taken a situation into my hands and acted upon it.",0
"Yes, yeah, I could notice those situations, and I think sometimes I can even begin to, like in this case, I can start to notice those situations even before they begin.",0
"Well, I did consciously try to make an effort to talk about, to go and confront the person with what had happened.",0
"Um-hmm. Yeah, I guess, I guess I am saying that.",0
"No, this was the time that I had done it this week. I know we had talked about doing it with Patrick. I didn’t try it with Patrick yet.",0
Yet.,0
I really think I could maybe try it with Patrick.,0
This—,0
—talking. Yeah.,0
Yeah.,0
Yeah. I think I’d like to try it with Patrick.,0
"Oh, yeah.",0
"Yeah, I didn’t have the courage to do it this week.",0
"Well, I did it once with the boss.",0
It turned out well.,0
I think I actually would like to try it with Patrick.,0
Not to try it?,0
"I think I could, yeah.",0
Okay.,0
"Me, too.",0
"Well, actually they’ve been a little better.",0
"Well, there were a couple of incidents this week that I think went differently, one with Patrick. Patrick and I had a plan to have dinner together. The kids were gone that night. And I rushed home from work early to make dinner, and he, again, came breezing in about an hour late and said, “Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot. We’ll have to do it some other time.” I started to feel really badly about that, and I started to walk upstairs, and I thought—I don’t know what I thought. But then I decided to go and tell Patrick. So I went to him and I said, “You know, Patrick, when we have a plan, and you just kind of breeze through and blow me off like that, it makes me feel really bad. I feel really kind of awful about it.” And you know, for once he really heard that. He was really listening, and apologized to me for doing that.",0
"Yeah, we did. And we talked a little. It turned out to be a nice evening.",0
"Well, it made me feel really good.",0
"That I told him, yeah.",0
Yeah. That he really listened and he seemed to take it in.,0
I guess. I guess I am.,0
"Yeah, yeah, in that case. I found that I didn’t… that it was much better, it felt much better, to work up the whatever, moxie, to say something to Patrick instead of just stuff it or let it go by.",0
"Well, there was one other one. I don’t know if it’s the same kind of thing, but with Lizzie, this week. I was thinking about my mom a lot this week, and one evening I took out all the old pictures of all the relatives, and a lot of pictures of my mom. And I saw a picture from her wedding that I hadn’t seen in a long time. And so I was just looking at it, trying to imagine about my mom at that time in her life, and Lizzie, I guess, walked by the room and saw me looking very strange, and so she came in and wanted to know what was going on. And I had just discovered this picture, or rediscovered it, and I was able to explain a little to Lizzie about her grandmother, my mother; what she was like.",0
"Well, actually, she was a lot more interested than I thought she would be. And we spent the rest of that evening talking about my mother.",0
"Yeah, actually. It made me feel good to be giving something of my mother to her, giving something of my life to her that she seemed to need.",0
"It was, actually.",0
"Oh, yeah. I can.",0
"Uh-hmm, uh-hmm.",0
"No, not at all. I can definitely see some differences in the person I was then and the person I am now.",0
"Well, um, I guess one of the things is that now I can begin to see when one of these attacks is coming on, is forming, and I can maybe change what I’m thinking, or the voice that’s running through my head into something else to make it stop or get control of it. When I’m starting  to feel like I have the choice of stuffing the feeling or not, I can try to talk to somebody, talk to the person about it—tell about it—and that will help me to get it out in another way than stuffing it.",0
"Well, I can change it. I don’t think it has really changed, but when I hear it I can change it and make it play a different voice, a different thing to say. I can change it into my voice.",0
