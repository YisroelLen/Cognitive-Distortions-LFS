72,well i started to get anxious and tense and i couldn t breathe and i can t do anything right i can t do anything,1
73,well i started to breathe i made myself become aware of my breathing i forced myself to take deep breath,0
74,well i just started to breathe and concentrate on the breathing,0
75,well i heard that a couple of time and i thought i have to change this so i just said to myself i said this isn t my fault i didn t do this,0
76,right i didn t do this it isn t my fault,0
77,well um it seemed to kind of relax me in a way with the breathing and the,0
78,yeah i did because,0
79,um hum i did,0
80,i said it wasn t my fault it wasn t my fault i didn t do anything wrong,0
81,well it seemed to kind of go away,0
82,the physical didn t happen i guess i guess it just stopped it didn t happen,0
83,oh um well i don t know,0
84,well not too good lately actually um i guess it s been since i ve gone to work the past couple of year thing have been getting more difficult,0
85,i guess that s when the tension started to come in,0
86,well i don t know maybe i wa finding some independence maybe he resents that,0
87,no he hasn t he just is kind of belittling you know about it but he hasn t really said anything,0
88,oh he make fun of it your little job he call it your little job,1
89,um it make me mad,0
90,yeah,0
91,yeah i think so,0
92,um,0
93,well patrick s been the person in my life for the past year,0
94,um well i guess my father he wa like that to me too,0
95,belittled me yes,0
96,yes,0
97,um hum cold,0
98,right told me i couldn t go to school i wasn t smart enough to go on to school,1
99,well it s been better this week i think i haven t had any panic attack but i don t know why i feel kind of worse actually,0
100,well more depressed i ve been thinking about a lot of thing and it just kind of make me feel terrible,1
101,well like we ve talked and i ve been trying to think about my father and that time of my life and why i m depressed now and i haven t been then or in the past many year why now am i having these attack and these depression,1
102,oh that s right i wa my daughter s age when my mother died of cancer,0
103,exactly i wa just like lizzie is now,0
104,my father wa depressed and drinking a lot he had been drinking before my mother died but not a much a now he had always been kind of mean to my mom like there were a lot of fight and he had an explosive personality he never hit her or anything like that but there were a lot of fight he wa mean sarcastic,0
105,yeah i would see it mostly i could hear it a lot i d listen to it i d be lying in bed at night listening to these fight i d always lie there and i wish she had more fight to her i wish she would just stand up and have some gut i always wished she had some moxie,0
106,it always made me feel very sad and depressed for her i don t know i just wish she could stand up to him,1
107,hmm i don t know what she really could have done being the kind of man he wa i don t know um i guess she did the best she could she kind of stood between him and u when she wa alive she kept the barrier there i think if it hadn t been for her he probably would have mixed anxiety and depression come after u that way,0
108,yeah he would yell at her and not at u he didn t ever yell at the little kid when she died he would yell at me kind of i took the place of her,0
109,yeah after she died,0
110,well um i just kind of took it all in and kept busy and took care of the kid and went on about my business and,0
111,well yeah i guess i kind of took in all his stuff and he could yell at me and tell me i wa a total failure and then he left them alone,1
112,well there wa one time that i don t know i had done something i can t even remember what it wa i just remember the situation that he told me i wa just stubborn i wa just so stubborn and she took me aside and she said no she said don t listen to him you re not stubborn you re tenacious that s what you are,0
113,uh hmm that s what she said so i guess in a way she wa more than a barrier against him she wa really a wonderful person i wish you could have known her,0
114,yeah she wa i guess she just knew thing about me that s kind of why i miss her so much,0
115,yeah,0
116,hmm no,0
117,i hadn t really thought about it like that but actually well the attack well this is kind of strange they really kind of started on lizzie s th birthday i guess there is a strong connection to that,1
118,um there wa something that happened with patrick that wa kind of surprising to me actually,0
119,well it wa on saturday everybody wa busy it wa hectic a usual and he had done some work met with some client even though it wa saturday and he came in acting very important he had so many thing to do and he just kind of brushed me off and i started to get really angry again and feel those feeling and i waited until he got off the phone and i went into the room and i went up to him and i said patrick you are such an asshole,1
120,and i never use any language like that with him at all with anybody,0
121,i don t think he knew whether to be angry or shocked or what so he just kind of ignored it the funny thing about it is that the rest of the day we kind of had a we had a really nice time and we went out that night,0
122,i hope not but it seemed like in this situation it kind of got a reaction that i wouldn t expect i mean i wouldn t expect it from myself either,0
123,i could take them all in and turn them against myself but in this case i just i guess i turned them against him,0
124,well this time it came out patrick you are such an asshole,1
125,no laughter,0
126,no,0
127,well when i said it i wa angry i wa beginning to get anxious but then after i stormed out of the room i said that to him and i stormed out of the room and i got back into the kitchen and i waited to see if there wa a reaction and there wasn t i guess i kind of thought it wa funny but i certainly felt the tension go i felt like yelling at everyone,1
128,lizzie joe laughter,0
129,i guess,0
130,what else could i have done dr meichenbaum what would a normal person do,0
131,i should have you tell him you say it better than me,0
132,i could try,0
133,patrick i m tired of you ignoring me all the time i think you should stop,1
134,hmm guilty,0
135,well it wa a pretty normal week but there wa one incident this week that i wa able to try to use the skill that we talked about,0
136,well i wa at work and i had ordered a tapestry to be delivered to a client for a showing and the tapestry didn t get there i wa very clear about the direction and where they were supposed to be and what time and it just didn t make it in time for the showing so the client got very angry and came back to the bos and yelled at him and the bos came and yelled at me,0
137,well i took it all in and the bos went back into the room and i started to get very upset and i thought well this is the time when i could try to use what we talked about last week so i thought about it for a minute and i went into the bos room and i said you know um when something like this happens and you yell at me it make me feel very bad and it s not any kind of way to work because this just wasn t my fault everything i did about getting the tapestry there wa right it wasn t my fault and you really have no right to yell at me about that and i don t think it s a good way to work,0
138,yeah i did i did,0
139,well by that time he had kind of calmed down a little and so i think he understood,0
140,well actually the amazing thing is that he kind of apologized for yelling at me like that and it made me feel really good,0
141,well i felt kind of proud that i had taken a situation into my hand and acted upon it,0
142,yes yeah i could notice those situation and i think sometimes i can even begin to like in this case i can start to notice those situation even before they begin,0
143,well i did consciously try to make an effort to talk about to go and confront the person with what had happened,0
144,um hmm yeah i guess i guess i am saying that,0
145,no this wa the time that i had done it this week i know we had talked about doing it with patrick i didn t try it with patrick yet,0
146,yet,0
147,i really think i could maybe try it with patrick,0
148,this,0
149,talking yeah,0
150,yeah,0
151,yeah i think i d like to try it with patrick,0
152,oh yeah,0
153,yeah i didn t have the courage to do it this week,0
154,well i did it once with the bos,0
155,it turned out well,0
156,i think i actually would like to try it with patrick,0
157,not to try it,0
158,i think i could yeah,0
159,okay,0
160,me too,0
161,well actually they ve been a little better,0
162,well there were a couple of incident this week that i think went differently one with patrick patrick and i had a plan to have dinner together the kid were gone that night and i rushed home from work early to make dinner and he again came breezing in about an hour late and said oh i m sorry i forgot we ll have to do it some other time i started to feel really badly about that and i started to walk upstairs and i thought i don t know what i thought but then i decided to go and tell patrick so i went to him and i said you know patrick when we have a plan and you just kind of breeze through and blow me off like that it make me feel really bad i feel really kind of awful about it and you know for once he really heard that he wa really listening and apologized to me for doing that,0
163,yeah we did and we talked a little it turned out to be a nice evening,0
164,well it made me feel really good,0
165,that i told him yeah,0
166,yeah that he really listened and he seemed to take it in,0
167,i guess i guess i am,0
168,yeah yeah in that case i found that i didn t that it wa much better it felt much better to work up the whatever moxie to say something to patrick instead of just stuff it or let it go by,0
169,well there wa one other one i don t know if it s the same kind of thing but with lizzie this week i wa thinking about my mom a lot this week and one evening i took out all the old picture of all the relative and a lot of picture of my mom and i saw a picture from her wedding that i hadn t seen in a long time and so i wa just looking at it trying to imagine about my mom at that time in her life and lizzie i guess walked by the room and saw me looking very strange and so she came in and wanted to know what wa going on and i had just discovered this picture or rediscovered it and i wa able to explain a little to lizzie about her grandmother my mother what she wa like,0
170,well actually she wa a lot more interested than i thought she would be and we spent the rest of that evening talking about my mother,0
171,yeah actually it made me feel good to be giving something of my mother to her giving something of my life to her that she seemed to need,0
172,it wa actually,0
173,oh yeah i can,0
174,uh hmm uh hmm,0
175,no not at all i can definitely see some difference in the person i wa then and the person i am now,0
176,well um i guess one of the thing is that now i can begin to see when one of these attack is coming on is forming and i can maybe change what i m thinking or the voice that s running through my head into something else to make it stop or get control of it when i m starting to feel like i have the choice of stuffing the feeling or not i can try to talk to somebody talk to the person about it tell about it and that will help me to get it out in another way than stuffing it,0
177,well i can change it i don t think it ha really changed but when i hear it i can change it and make it play a different voice a different thing to say i can change it into my voice,0
0,so yesterday i get home after a long day at work and i check my email and there is an email from this guy i hooked up with like year ago something like that,0
3,that s kinda like what i wa like i wa like wow i wa like really excited,0
6,i did i felt really exited and i wa like i felt sort of guilty about feeling excited because i m like hello i m married almost year but somebody wa obviously paying some kind of attention to me i have not talked to this guy i haven t seen this guy this guy is really like joe random out of the blue like nothing from him for year ago,0
9,and i m so flattered i mean it wasn t that big of a deal the email whatever but i m so flattered that i almost wish that that random email that act would have been from my husband but it wasn t and i got off on the fact that it wa from this guy,0
12,it could have been any guy it could have been any guy,0
15,definitely uh huh,0
18,yeah like i kind of feel neglected a little bit i mean i know that i m not it s crazy cuz i know i m not actually neglected i think it s really more my issue,1
21,you know he work more than full time he work probably like hour a week,0
24,he take class,0
27,umm he actually doe more in the house than i do i mean he s i mean he s actually working le so i kind of make sense in a way but like i mean he doe the laundry he doe the dish he iron my clothes in the morning i mean by all account most woman would think that i have it made umm and i kind of do and but just the spark like i still need the spark just because it s been year doesn t mean i don t need the spark,0
30,like what it mean to me you mean,0
33,sigh it s a really good question i mean pause there is you know i think with all relationship there is like a newness that happens you know when you first start and like you re like dating i mean i don t know i mean it s really hard to explain so going back to this dating thing cuz that s what keep coming to my head like you court the person i mean i know that s an old fashion term and it probably sound really corny but you do thing like you make yourself attractive to that person you re romantic you re available there s like all these thing that you are to make yourself attractive to the other person and umm i think that it s really important i mean in marriage to still do that and i know that i m having trouble doing that right now because of all my commitment and my husband and i had a long talk about that before all these change started and what that wa going to look like and if it wa manageable but i still think like i am really emotionally available and i i mean i don t bring him flower and stuff cuz he s never asked for like that being what he needed or whatever um he want thing like sex which i give him because i guess that s what he s driven by but i need i need that whatever that it s hard to explain what that spark is but i think you kind of maybe get the picture it s just that newness that freshness that alive feeling like,0
36,the surprise like what s waiting around the corner so i guess and that s the whole thing that that s why i got off on the email you know i mean it really is like out of the clear random blue sky whatever this guy that i had a thing for year ago is still thinking about me like that whole that whole concept is kind of blow my mind,0
39,uh huh,0
42,uh huh,0
45,he doe a lot yeah,0
48,a lot,0
51,um i mean it obviously make me feel happy and relieved proud umm lucky you know but the thing is like i mean i tell him this umm i m really good about that i m very communicative even when i don t want to be even when i feel like crap like i thank him and don t get me wrong i handle other responsibility in our household like his mom would never have a birthday card if i didn t send it and shop for it and pick it out and the whole bit like his sister like all of that stuff none of that stuff would get done the bill would never be paid the checkbook would never be balanced i mean we each have our thing that we are good at and we play to our strength,1
54,um and my husband i mean he s a really good guy i just feel like i need a little more i do think it s within me i think that i feel so tired and run down and like drained that i m probably looking outside of myself for support and motivation and maybe that s the wrong idea i don t know,1
57,yeah i think it is like that like i need a lot of umm i do need a lot of validation like i tend to be very hard on myself so i never know if like i m good enough at work if i m good enough at my internship if i m a good enough wife if i m a good enough daughter i mean i think we ll need a lot more session to cover all that i mean i think there is a reason for that i think it come from my past umm,1

209,look at all the thing i have done badly,1
210,my boyfriend wa late in picking me up he doesn't really want to go out with me tonight,1
211,she is so talented i'll never amount to anything,1
212,if i had spent more time preparing for my presentation it could have been better,1
213,this is the worst thing that could happen i can t manage it,1
214,it's my fault that my husband drink if i were a better wife he wouldn't do that,1
215,you don't know what you're talking about we have to do it my way or it won't work,1
216,i spent all that time fixing a nice dinner and no one appreciated it,1
217,if she told me she loved me more often then i could feel happy,1
218,i deserve a day off from work since i worked hard over the weekend but my bos won't allow it,1
219,problem at work are all my fault,1
220,my partner need to change for me to be happy,1
221,i know i'm going to get fired,1
222,why doe he do this to me,1
223,this always happens to me,1
224,i ll never learn cbt,1
225,it s possible they were distracted,0
226,they weren t angry last time we talked,0
227,i would likely know if i had done something wrong,0
228,it s actually not a pattern this doesn t usually occur,0
229,while i have struggled with presentation before i ve practiced and prepared for this presentation and have no proof that this will not go well,0
230,i make mistake sometimes but in general i am not careless or irresponsible,0
231,i am genuinely trying my best,0
232,the people my mistake impacted may have been a little upset but there is no evidence they think i m incompetent,0
233,i can improve my work based on what i learned from my mistake,0
234,i made a mistake at work but everyone doe that from time to time i usually get a lot of positive feedback about my work i'll be careful not to make that same mistake again,0
235,it s normal to feel and think this way i m just reacting like this because of that time when i wa,0
236,this is the anxiety talking,0
237,i don t know what they re really thinking,0
238,they re actually probably genuinely concerned about me,0
239,they must care about me to ask so won t judge me negatively,0
240,i would ask someone the same if i met them in these circumstance,0
241,the feeling will pas,0
242,it s normal to feel so tired it s because i m depressed,0
243,i felt a bit better yesterday after my shower and managed to tidy up a bit,0
244,if i get up now maybe i can walk to the corner shop then phone a friend,0
245,he s probably in a hurry and just didn t see me,0
246,i m probably over reacting a bit,0
247,no harm ha been done really,0
248,i ll have forgotten about this next week,0
249,i ll feel better if i can just let this go,0
250,the flaw wa minor and did not alter the conclusion,0
251,the analysis wa objectively sound and my suggestion wa realistic and well founded,0
252,i wa top of my class when i trained in the analysis method,0
253,my client respect my analysis and my opinion,0
254,my analysis wa reasonable but not perfect,0
255,there wa an error but it didn't affect the validity of the conclusion,0
256,i contribute to my family in new way such a offering advice and support,0
257,because of my copd and because i am getting older i have more physical limitation than i used to and i do need my family s help from time to time but i am able to offer them many valuable thing and contribute to my grandkids life,0
258,i'm actually only boring when i'm in a bad mood when i'm in a good mood i'm pretty funny,0
259,i'm getting better at relationship all the time and am making a strong effort to improve my social skill and decrease my social anxiety,0
260,it's okay to sometime be strange in fact people often enjoy someone who's different,0
261,my family know the real me my ex know the real me and my friend know the real me so this thought is nonsense,0
262,they might be annoyed that i wasn t keeping up with my chore but no one else ha said or done anything that show they hate me,0
263,i feel lonely now but the feeling is temporary and i will adjust and make friend,0
264,i haven t done everything that i planned but i have done some thing like painting and cooking,0
265,recovery from depression is hard work and it take time,0
266,i am making progress,0
267,i don t know whether the therapy will work or how i will feel in the future all i can do is try my best today,0
268,actually i love how i look in that black dress i m just so frustrated right now i m forgetting about what s actually good in my closet,0
269,i have no way of knowing for sure that every future date will turn me down because how i m dressed i can t predict the future,0
270,this outfit doesn t help me feel my best but that s not the case with all of my clothes,0
271,i can t predict that my co worker will even notice how i m dressed today and i can t predict what kind of people i will end up on date with in the future,0
272,besides i want people to appreciate me for who i am not how i look on one particular day,0
273,it may take time but i will find a good job,0
274,although i lost my job i have many past success that will help propel my future forward,0
275,if the librarian is judgmental then i can cope with that it s highly unlikely anyone will call security and boot me out of the library or anything like that,0
276,i m expecting other people to judge me negatively for making a mistake but maybe they won t,0
277,other than explaining the situation politely to someone at the library there s nothing i can do to control their reaction and the consequence in term of how big the fine is so giving up trying to control this situation and using acceptance skill is wise,0
278,this is a situation i have the capacity to deal with i ve developed a pattern of avoidant coping but i can get better at non avoidant coping through the right kind of practice this is an opportunity for that,0
279,by not mentioning this to my therapist i ve lost the potential opportunity to get a supportive reaction and to talk about problem solving,0
280,it s understandable to want to hide and avoid in response to shame and anxiety but it s not very helpful,0
281,she must have a lot on her mind,0
282,my speech might only be ok but if i do mess up everyone will forget about it soon enough,0
