19997,just finished watching your song present boystown,0
19998,awww i can't wait to get one,0
19999,doing nothing,1
0,simplistic silly and tedious,1
1,it's so laddish and juvenile only teenage boy could possibly find it funny,1
2,exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crime bearable,1
3,garbus discard the potential for pathological study exhuming instead the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation,1
4,a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification,1
5,the story is also a unoriginal a they come already having been recycled more time than i'd care to count,1
6,about the only thing to give the movie point for is bravado to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time,1
7,not so much farcical a sour,1
8,unfortunately the story and the actor are served with a hack script,1
9,all the more disquieting for it relatively gore free allusion to the serial murder but it fall down in it attempt to humanize it subject,1
10,a sentimental mess that never ring true,1
11,while the performance are often engaging this loose collection of largely improvised number would probably have worked better a a one hour tv documentary,1
12,interesting but not compelling,1
13,on a cutting room floor somewhere lie footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire,1
14,while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock stock and two smoking barrel and snatch ha the bod he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle,1
15,there is a difference between movie with the courage to go over the top and movie that don't care about being stupid,1
16,nothing here seems a funny a it did in analyze this not even joe viterelli a de niro's right hand goombah,1
17,such master screenwriting come courtesy of john pogue the yale grad who previously gave u the skull and last year's rollerball enough said except film overboard,1
18,here common sense fly out the window along with the hail of bullet none of which ever seem to hit sascha,1
19,this minute movie only ha about minute of decent material,1
20,the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turn in a pretty convincing performance a a prissy teenage girl,1
21,on it own it's not very interesting a a remake it's a pale imitation,1
22,it show that some studio firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product a long a there's a little girl on girl action,1
23,a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise it isn't a comparison to reality so much a it is a commentary about our knowledge of film,1
24,a exciting a all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer the rest of u will be lulled into a coma,1
25,the party scene deliver some tawdry kick the rest of the film is dudsville,1
26,our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all night tequila bender and i know this because i've seen 'jackass the movie ',1
27,the criticism never rise above easy cynical potshot at morally bankrupt character,1
28,the movie's something borrowed construction feel le the product of loving well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan thinly sketched story killing time that's all that's going on here,1
29,stupid infantile redundant sloppy over the top and amateurish yep it's waking up in reno go back to sleep,1
30,somewhere in the middle the film compels a demme experiment he harvest a few movie moment gem but the field of roughage dominates,1
31,the action clich s just pile up,1
32,payami try to raise some serious issue about iran's electoral process but the result is a film that's about a subtle a a party political broadcast,1
33,the only surprise is that heavyweight joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this i assume the director ha picture of them cavorting in ladies' underwear,1
34,another useless recycling of a brutal mid ' s american sport movie,1
35,i didn't laugh i didn't smile i survived,1
36,please someone stop eric schaeffer before he make another film,1
37,most of the problem with the film don't derive from the screenplay but rather the mediocre performance by most of the actor involved,1
38,if you're just in the mood for a fun but bad movie you might want to catch freak a a matinee,1
39,curling may be a unique sport but men with broom is distinctly ordinary,1
40,though the opera itself take place mostly indoors jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set,1
41,there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerd revisited again,1
42,the effort is sincere and the result are honest but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable,1
43,analyze that regurgitates and water down many of the previous film's success with a few new swing thrown in,1
44,with flashbulb editing a cover for the absence of narrative continuity undisputed is nearly incoherent an excuse to get to the closing bout by which time it's impossible to care who win,1
45,stink from start to finish like a wet burlap sack of gloom,1
46,to the civilized mind a movie like ballistic eck v sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement,1
47,equlibrium could pas for a thirteen year old's book report on the totalitarian theme of and farenheit,1
48,the lack of naturalness make everything seem self consciously poetic and forced it's a pity that nelson's achievement doesn't match his ambition,1
49,everything is off,1
50,when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout 'hey kool aid ',1
51,an easy watch except for the annoying demeanour of it lead character,1
52,imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story ' with ali macgraw's profanity replaced by romance novel platitude,1
53,pc stability notwithstanding the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat fairy tale conclusion,1
54,forget the misleading title what's with the unexplained baboon cameo,1
55,an odd haphazard and inconsequential romantic comedy,1
56,though her fan will assuredly have their funny bone tickled others will find their humor seeking dollar best spent elsewhere,1
57,pascale bailly's rom com provides am lie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin i e a banal spiritual quest,1
58,a static and sugary little half hour after school special about interfaith understanding stretched out to minute,1
59,watching the chemistry between freeman and judd however almost make this movie worth seeing almost,1
60,a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman,1
61,the country bear ha no scene that will upset or frighten young viewer unfortunately there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them either,1
62,the cumulative effect of watching this minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trot out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge before long you're desperate for the evening to end,1
63,the character are never more than sketch which leaf any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach,1
64,mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personality that parade about a if they were coming back from stock character camp a drowsy drama infatuated by it own pretentious self examination,1
65,only in it final surprising shot doe rabbit proof fence find the authority it's looking for,1
66,isn't a sharp a the original despite some visual virtue 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it,1
67,play like a badly edited minute trailer and the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going in fact it doesn't even seem like she tried,1
68,maybe leblanc thought hey the movie about the baseball playing monkey wa worse,1
69,what you expect is just what you get assuming the bar of expectation hasn't been raised above sixth grade height,1
70,barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time,1
71,the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that even in all it director's cut glory he's made a film that's barely shocking barely interesting and most of all barely anything,1
72,so riddled with unanswered question that it requires gargantuan leap of faith just to watch it plod along,1
73,i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again she should ask for a raise,1
74,earnest but heavy handed,1
75,if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minute but instead the plot go out of it way to introduce obstacle for him to stumble over,1
76,too slow for a younger crowd too shallow for an older one,1
77,there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening the adventure of pluto nash is a big time stinker,1
78,a punch line without a premise a joke built entirely from musty memory of half dimensional character,1
79,take one character we don't like and another we don't believe and put them into a battle of will that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny,1
80,the thing this movie try to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewer,1
81,even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actor in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate tiresome ugliness it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest,1
82,sitting through the last reel spoiler alert is significantly le charming than listening to a four year old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house,1
83,confuses it message with an ultimate desire to please and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actress nor their character deserve,1
84,deadly dull pointless meditation on loser in a gone to seed hotel,1
85,with this new rollerball sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized a robotic sentiment,1
86,one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off,1
87,a movie more to be prescribed than recommended a visually bland a a dentist's waiting room complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythm,1
88,sex ironically ha little to do with the story which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibility and that you should never ever leave a large dog alone with a toddler but never mind all that the boob are fantasti,1
89,the script cover huge heavy topic in a bland surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why for instance good thing happen to bad people,1
90,a portrait of alienation so perfect it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewer,1
91,the code talker deserved better than a hollow tribute,1
92,skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd,1
93,feel like a cold old man going through the motion,1
94,dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree can you bear the laughter,1
95,dull and mechanical kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit,1
96,there's no point of view no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standard allow for plenty of nudity,1
97,beware the quirky brit com they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental,1
98,ha it moment and almost a many subplots,1
99,the gag and the script are a mixed bag,1
100,completely awful iranian drama a much fun a a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque,1
101,narratively trouble every day is a plodding mess,1
102,there's no point in extracting the bare bone of byatt's plot for purpose of bland hollywood romance,1
103,director john musker and ron clements the team behind the little mermaid have produced sparkling retina candy but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space,1
104,adam sandler's heart may be in the right place but he need to pull his head out of his butt,1
105,there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan but it's also one that next to his best work feel clumsy and convoluted,1
106,despite engaging offbeat touch knockaround guy rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's a fresh faced a it young gun cast,1
107,it's all pretty tame the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it,1
108,the movie is a mess from start to finish,1
109,the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also make her appear foolish and shallow rather than a wa more likely a victim of mental illness,1
